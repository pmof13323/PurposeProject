Hi, I'm Jack Brown, a senior at Lincoln High. I'm passionate about environmental science, particularly renewable energy innovations. When I'm not buried in books, you'll find me captaining our school's soccer team or experimenting with amateur astronomy. I love combining my interests in technology and nature by building gadgets that help monitor local wildlife. My dream is to study environmental engineering in college, aiming to develop sustainable solutions for global energy challenges. In my downtime, I enjoy hiking and capturing the beauty of nature through photography, which I share on my small but growing Instagram page. If I woke up to find all humans gone, I'd first try to grasp the situation, checking news and social media for any clues. Realizing I'm alone, I'd focus on survival: securing food, water, and shelter. With no people, I'd explore and document this new world, using libraries and the internet as long as they're functional, to learn necessary survival skills. I'd care for any animals I encounter, creating a small haven for them. Amidst the silence, I'd reflect on humanity's impact and legacy, preserving what knowledge I can, while embracing the surreal peace and freedom of this unique solitude.
